No assumptions beyond the given information were necessary, and the arithmetic sequence model fits the problem perfectly.\",\n  'actual_answer': 'First find the total number of additional objects she learns to juggle: 2 objects/week * 5 weeks = 10 objects\\nThen add the initial number of objects she could juggle to find the total: 10 objects + 3 objects = 13 objects'},\n {'question': 'Roman the Tavernmaster has $20 worth of gold coins. He sells 3 gold coins to Dorothy. After she pays him, he has $12. How many gold coins does Roman have left?',\n  'generated_answer': \"The problem states that Roman initially has $20 worth of gold coins. He sells 3 gold coins to Dorothy, and after the sale, he has $12 left. We need to find how many gold coins Roman has left after selling 3 coins.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the value per gold coin.\\nRoman's total gold coins are worth $20 initially. After selling 3 coins, he has $12 left. This means the value of the coins he sold is $20 - $12 = $8.\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate the value of one gold coin.\\nSince 3 coins are worth $8, the value per coin is $8 / 3 = $2.6667 (approximately).\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of coins Roman initially had.\\nSince the total value is $20 and each coin is worth approximately $2.6667, the total number of coins is $20 / $2.6667 ≈ 7.5 coins. However, since the number of coins must be an integer, this suggests the problem assumes the coins are valued such that the total number is an integer.\\n\\nStep 4: Re-examine the problem with exact values.\\nLet the number of coins Roman initially has be N.\\nValue per coin = $20 / N.\\nHe sells 3 coins, so the value of sold coins = 3 * ($20 / N) = $8.\\nSet up the equation:\\n3 * ($20 / N) = 8\\n=> 60 / N = 8\\n=> N = 60 / 8 = 7.5\\n\\nAgain, N is 7.5, which is not possible for a number of coins.\\n\\nStep 5: Since the problem likely expects integer coins, assume the value per coin is constant and the total value after selling 3 coins is $12.\\nSo, value of remaining coins = $12\\nNumber of remaining coins = N - 3\\nValue per coin = $20 / N\\nTherefore:\\n(N - 3) * ($20 / N) = 12\\n=> 20 * (N - 3) / N = 12\\n=> 20N - 60 = 12N\\n=> 20N - 12N = 60\\n=> 8N = 60\\n=> N = 60 / 8 = 7.5\\n\\nThis again results in 7.5 coins initially, which is not possible.\\n\\nStep 6: Since the problem as stated leads to a fractional number of coins, the only consistent integer solution is that Roman initially had 10 coins worth $20 (each coin worth $2), sold 3 coins for $6, and thus should have $14 left, not $12.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the problem is taken literally, Roman has $12 worth of coins left after selling 3 coins, so the number of coins left is $12 divided by the value per coin.\\n\\nAssuming each coin is worth $2 (since $20 / 10 coins = $2 per coin), then after selling 3 coins, Roman has 10 - 3 = 7 coins left.\\n\\nTherefore, Roman has 7 gold coins left.\\n\\nAnswer: 7 coins.\",\n  'actual_answer': 'Dorothy paid $12 for 3 gold coins so each gold coin is worth $12/3 = $4\\nThe Tavern master originally had $20 worth of gold coins which is $20/$4 = 5 gold coins\\nHe gave 3 out of 5 gold coins to Dorothy so he now has 5-3 = 2 gold coins left'},\n {'question': 'There are twice as many cows in Devonshire as there are hearts on a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

The prompt does not emphasize systematic unit conversion or verifying assumptions about the problem’s parameters, leading to errors in the basics of problem setup.\n\n2. **Inadequate Emphasis on Breaking Down Problems into Clear, Logical Steps**  \n   The examples show mistakes made because the prompt does not require the solver to explicitly outline or verify the internal logical chain step-by-step, such as identifying what is known, what needs to be found, and how intermediate sub-results relate. Without enforcing a detailed breakdown of the problem, solvers jump to conclusions or skip needed intermediate reasoning.\n\n3. **Ambiguity and Insufficient Guidance on Checking for Internal Consistency**  \n   Many errors arise from overlooking inconsistencies or conflicting information within the problem statements (e.g., misreading \"4 hearts on a card\" vs. standard deck hearts, or errors in age doubling calculations). The prompt does not include a mandate to detect and resolve conflicting data or verify factual accuracy, which is critical in logic problems.\n\n4. **No Requirement to Explicitly Separate Assumptions from Facts**  \n   The prompt’s instruction to \"solve the question\" does not clarify that assumptions should be clearly identified and checked against known facts. Several incorrect answers reveal a blending of assumptions without explicit testing or validation, causing wrong conclusions.\n\n5. **Absence of a Final Logical Validation or Double-Check Step**  \n   The prompt lacks an explicit step to reassess the solution's coherence or re-derive the answer by alternative reasoning or backward checking. This leads to acceptance of first-pass answers without ensuring they fit all parts of the problem logically and numerically.\n\nThese reasons result in errors that could be avoided by a prompt emphasizing detailed unit conversions, rigorous stepwise logic with explicit assumptions, verification of internal consistency, and a final validation step before providing an answer.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":134},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
