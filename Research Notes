Could you please clarify:
1. What is the intended use case for the framework? (e.g., improving performance on reasoning tasks, code generation, question answering)
2. What environment will it operate in? (e.g., interactive agent loop, static prompt tuning, API-based LLM usage)

Great. I’ll synthesize a unified, generalized framework that combines the strengths of ProTeGi (gradient-inspired beam search optimization) and Reflexion (verbal reinforcement learning) into a system for API-based LLMs. This framework will aim to improve prompt performance across all task types and include key features like causal credit assignment mechanisms, optimization trace, and performance tracking.
I’ll also identify additional components that would make the system robust, such as adaptive exploration strategies, memory management, and automatic failure mode categorization. I’ll get back to you with a structured framework shortly.

Unified Prompt Optimization Framework Using ProTeGi and Reflexion

Unified Prompt Optimization Framework
Our framework integrates discrete prompt editing (inspired by ProTeGi’s “textual gradients”) with iterative self-reflection (inspired by Reflexion’s verbal RL) into a single optimization loop. At each iteration, the system maintains a pool of candidate prompts and performs the following steps:
* Answer & Reflect: For each prompt, query the LLM to produce an answer (or code, classification, etc.) on the target task. Then prompt the LLM to reflect on that answer in natural language (e.g. critique mistakes or suggest improvements). This leverages Reflexion-style verbal feedback to identify weaknesses or clarifications needed.
* Propose Edits: Convert the LLM’s reflection into prompt edits. For example, if the reflection notes a missing example, add an illustrative example to the prompt. Simultaneously, apply discrete “textual gradient” edits to the prompt: insert or substitute keywords, change phrasing, or reorder instructions. These edits are guided by measuring how small prompt changes affect the LLM’s output quality. (For instance, add or remove a hint word and observe if performance improves.)
* Evaluate Variants: Query the LLM with all edited prompt variants and measure their outputs using the chosen task metric (accuracy, F1, pass@1, etc.). Select the best-performing prompt(s) for the next iteration. This selection uses the ProTeGi idea of comparing outcomes under slight prompt perturbations to estimate a “gradient” direction in prompt space.
These steps form a closed-loop optimization: the model’s own feedback (self-reflection) suggests semantic improvements, while gradient-inspired perturbations fine-tune phrasing. By alternating between self-reflection (interpreting the LLM’s natural-language critique) and textual-gradient edits, the prompt gradually evolves to boost performance across diverse tasks (reasoning, coding, classification, decision-making, etc.).
Credit-Assignment Mechanism
We formalize prompt editing as a sequential decision process to identify which changes truly improve performance. Key elements include:
* Markov Decision Formulation: Treat each prompt version as a state, prompt-edit actions (token insertion/deletion/substitution) as actions, and the evaluation score (accuracy, pass rate, etc.) as reward. Over iterations, we accumulate rewards for a sequence of edits.
* Temporal-Difference Updates: Apply TD learning ideas to propagate credit backward. For example, when a sequence of prompt edits yields a high final score, earlier edits in the sequence receive retroactive credit. This can be done by updating an action-value estimate for each edit using the difference between successive scores.
* Counterfactual Testing: For fine-grained credit, generate alternative prompts that differ by one component (e.g. remove one instruction or substitute a synonym) and compare outcomes. This counterfactual analysis isolates each edit’s effect. If removing a word causes a drop in accuracy, that word was likely beneficial.
* Causal Filtering: Organize the prompt into components (e.g. exemplars, constraints, questions). Use causal reasoning to test which components drive success. For instance, systematically omit or scramble one part while keeping others fixed, attributing changes in performance to that part. Over many trials, a statistical filter can identify prompt elements with strong causal impact.
* Credit Attribution: Combine the above by assigning a credit score to each prompt attribute (word, sentence, example). These scores guide future edits: high-credit elements are preserved or emphasized, low-credit elements are revised.
Together, these mechanisms ensure that the system “knows” which prompt changes led to improvements, rather than treating each iteration as a black box. This allows smart search over prompt space (e.g. using bandit or RL algorithms) instead of blind trial-and-error.
Optimization Trace Logging
To enable analysis and reproducibility, the framework logs every step of the prompt evolution:
* Prompt History: Record each prompt variant, its difference from the previous prompt, and the timestamp/iteration number. Store diffs (edits made) to trace how the prompt text changes over time.
* Reflections and Edits: Log the LLM’s reflective output and how it was interpreted into prompt edits. This shows why certain modifications were made.
* Evaluation Results: For each prompt, log the model’s answers and the computed metrics. If ground truth is available (e.g. for classification or coding tests), log those results (accuracy, F1, pass@k). If only proxy scores exist (e.g. LLM confidence), log those too.
* Action Metadata: Log which editing strategy was used (e.g. “added clarifying example”, “synonym substitution”, “reordered steps”) for each change. This builds a record of which strategies tend to help.
A centralized log (or a version-controlled datastore) captures the full “optimization trace.” This supports debugging (seeing exactly which edits helped), visualization (plotting metric improvement over iterations), and further analysis (e.g. clustering prompt versions).
Performance Metrics Tracking
The system continuously monitors task-specific metrics to guide optimization:
* Task Metrics: Define appropriate metric(s) per task. For classification or QA, use accuracy, F1, or BLEU. For code generation, use pass@k or exact match on test cases. For reasoning/decision tasks, use correctness or utility scores.
* Iteration Metrics: After each prompt generation, compute the metric on a validation set or via API feedback. Record this score as the reward for that prompt.
* Progress Monitoring: Track metrics over iterations to ensure convergence. For example, stop when accuracy plateaus or stops improving beyond noise. Plotting metric vs. iteration gives insight into improvement rate.
* Multi-Metric Optimization: If a task has multiple aspects (e.g. code correctness and efficiency), combine them into a reward function or track them separately and consider Pareto improvement.
By systematically recording metrics, the framework can adapt its search: for example, if accuracy stops improving but reflection suggests a different weakness, it can switch focus. The logs also allow post-hoc analysis of how many iterations (or how many edits) were needed to reach a target score.
Black-Box API Compatibility
The design assumes no access to model internals; it works with any LLM via its API:
* Output-Only Interaction: All operations use the LLM’s response text (and possibly probability scores if the API provides them). We never require gradients or model weights. Discrete prompt edits effectively approximate a gradient by observing output changes.
* Query Budgeting: Because API calls may be limited or costly, the system can limit candidate edits per iteration (e.g. only a few top-√N edits, or use parallel queries). It can reuse past results (cache answers for identical prompts).
* Any LLM or Version: Since it treats the LLM as a black box, the framework can be applied to GPT, PaLM, Llama, etc. If the model’s behavior changes (e.g. a new version), the system automatically adapts via fresh feedback.
* Probability Signals (optional): If the API returns token probabilities or confidences, those signals can be used to refine edits (e.g. penalize prompts that yield low-confidence answers). However, the core algorithm does not depend on such internal scores.
This ensures general-purpose applicability: users can deploy the framework on any language model API without extra infrastructure.
Additional Efficiency & Generalization Features
To further boost efficiency and make the system broadly applicable, we include several complementary mechanisms:
* Dynamic Memory / Knowledge Bank: Maintain a memory of successful prompt fragments, exemplars, or tricks discovered during optimization. For a new task, the system can retrieve relevant high-performing snippets (based on task similarity) to initialize or seed the prompt. This transfer of prompt “skills” speeds up optimization on novel tasks.
* Context-Aware Paraphrasing: Use the LLM itself (or a separate paraphraser) to rephrase prompts without changing their meaning. This can overcome rigid phrasing issues. For example, if the prompt becomes too repetitive or unnatural, a controlled paraphrase (guided by reflection) can make it clearer while preserving content. Paraphrasing diversifies candidates in each iteration.
* Failure-Mode Categorization: As reflections identify error types (e.g. logical fallacy vs. factual gap vs. formatting issue), cluster these failure modes. Then apply targeted strategies: e.g. add background context for factual errors, or step-by-step scaffolding for logic errors. This avoids one-size-fits-all editing. Over time, the system learns which prompt edits fix which error categories.
* Adaptive Candidate Pruning: Begin with many candidate edits per iteration but prune aggressively. For example, generate 10 prompt variants but only keep the top 2 for deeper search. Use heuristics or learned models to discard edits that consistently underperform. This focuses compute on promising directions, reducing API calls.
* Ensemble Search & Exploration: Maintain multiple parallel prompt “trajectories” (like separate agents). If one trajectory stalls, others might find a better basin of attraction. Techniques like epsilon-greedy (occasionally exploring a random edit) or simulated annealing (allowing worse edits early to escape local optima) can be applied.
* Adaptive Editing Granularity: Dynamically adjust edit size. Early iterations might use large edits (add examples, instructions) to get rough gains, while later iterations fine-tune word choice. The system can measure sensitivity: if small edits produce large score changes, it may focus on fine edits.
* Integration with Retrieval or External Tools: For knowledge-intensive tasks, allow the prompt to include retrieved facts or call external tools (e.g. code execution). The optimization loop can then also refine how external information is incorporated.
Each of these features helps the system generalize (works across domains with minimal tuning) and run efficiently (fewer queries, faster convergence). For instance, memory and paraphrasing exploit the LLM’s strong language abilities to guide prompt design, while candidate pruning and ensemble search use algorithmic strategies to manage the search space. Framework Summary: In practice, this unified framework operates as follows. The system takes an initial prompt and repeatedly loops: generate answers, produce self-reflections, apply both textual-gradient-inspired edits and semantic edits suggested by reflection, evaluate the new prompts, and log all information. A credit-assignment mechanism (drawing on reinforcement learning ideas) continually updates which prompt elements are valuable. Over time, the prompt converges to an optimized form for the task. By design, it uses only API queries and records metrics and changes at each step. This modular yet integrated approach makes the framework applicable to any API-based LLM and any task type. Researchers or practitioners can implement it by combining: (1) a prompt-editing module (implementing ProTeGi-style perturbations), (2) a self-reflection module (issuing reflection prompts to the LLM), (3) a reward system (task-specific scoring), and (4) logging/analysis tools. The additional features (memory, paraphrasing, pruning, etc.) can be added to enhance performance. Overall, this framework systematically marries discrete, gradient-like search with verbal introspective feedback to optimize prompts in a traceable, generalizable way.

Thought for 4 seconds

End-to-end pipeline — Unified ProTeGi + Reflexion prompt optimizer
Below is a complete, implementation-ready pipeline that merges ProTeGi’s gradient-style prompt editing with Reflexion’s verbal reinforcement, plus the extra features you requested (credit assignment, memory, paraphrasing, failure-mode taxonomy, pruning, ensemble search, logging, etc.). I give the stages, dataflows, components, control logic, pseudocode, prompts/templates, recommended hyperparameters and practical engineering notes so you can implement this against any black-box LLM API.

1 — High-level overview (one-line)
Start from an initial prompt → evaluate on a validation minibatch → collect outputs → generate LLM self-reflections → produce many edited prompt candidates (textual-gradients + semantic edits) → paraphrase / diversify → evaluate candidates on sampled data → select best candidates with bandit/selection algorithm → assign credit to prompt components via counterfactuals & TD-style propagation → update memory and heuristics → repeat until stop. Log everything.

2 — System components (modules)
1. Controller / Orchestrator
    * Drives iterations, manages budgets, schedules parallel queries, and termination.
2. Prompt Store & Versioning
    * Stores full prompt text, diffs, metadata, component segmentation (header, task description, examples, constraints).
3. Evaluator
    * Runs evaluation metric m (accuracy, F1, pass@k, exact match) on held-out validation/dev subset. Can call test harness (e.g., unit tests for code).
4. Reflection Module (Reflexion)
    * Sends generation+result to LLM asking for verbalized critique / lessons (SR). Produces structured reflection output (failure types, suggested fixes).
5. Textual-Gradient Editor (ProTeGi)
    * Given reflection + errors, generate focused edits (add clarifications, rephrase constraints, change example selection). Produces N direct edits.
6. Paraphrase / Monte-Carlo Generator
    * Produces paraphrases and small perturbations of each candidate to explore local neighborhoods.
7. Selection / Bandit Module
    * Efficiently allocates evaluation budget across candidates (UCB, UCB-E, Successive Rejects, Successive Halving). Returns top-k for next beam.
8. Credit Assignment Engine
    * Runs counterfactual tests, TD-style backpropagation of reward across edit sequence, and computes per-component credit scores.
9. Memory / Knowledge Bank
    * Stores high-credit prompt snippets, failure-mode examples, mapping from failure classes → repair strategies.
10. Logging & Trace DB
    * Stores all prompts, diffs, reflections, evaluations, credit scores, budgets. Exposes visualization APIs.
11. Policy & Heuristics
    * Controls exploration/exploitation, edit granularity, annealing schedule.
12. Cache & Throttling
    * Caches LLM responses per (prompt, input) pair and enforces API rate/budget constraints.

3 — Data model / storage schema (suggested JSON)
* PromptVersion:
    * id, text, parent_id, components (array {name, start, end, text}), edits (list of diffs), created_by (gradient/reflection/paraphrase), credit_scores (per-component), metrics (per-dataset).
* Reflection:
    * id, prompt_id, inputs_sampled, predictions, gt_labels, reflection_text, structured_tags (failure_types, suggested_edits)
* EvalRecord:
    * prompt_id, dataset_split, timestamp, metric_values, raw_outputs
* MemoryEntry:
    * snippet, task_signatures (task type, tokens), credit, example_inputs, failure_modes_fixed
Store in a versioned DB (e.g., PostgreSQL + S3 blobs or a document DB).

4 — Pipeline stages (detailed)
A. Setup & Initialization
* Inputs: initial prompt p0, task dataset D split into Dtrain, Dval, Dtest.
* Initialize beam B = {p0}.
* Configure: beam width b, minibatch size |Dmini|, max_iters R, query_budget BUDGET, candidate_gen params.
* Seed memory with p0 components and default heuristics.
Suggested defaults:
* b = 4, |Dmini| = 32 (or smaller for costly APIs), R = 6-10, candidates_per_parent = 8, paraphrases_per_candidate = 2.
B. Main loop (per iteration)
1. Sample minibatch Dmini ⊂ Dtrain (stratify by class/task difficulty if possible).
2. Evaluate Beam: For each prompt p ∈ B, run LLM on Dmini, collect predictions ŷ. Compute metrics m(p, Dmini). Log EvalRecord.
3. For prompts with errors, call Reflection Module:
    * Prompt template (see section 7) asks LLM to: (a) identify why outputs failed; (b) give structured tags (e.g., missing constraint, ambiguous instruction, wrong format, hallucination); (c) suggest specific edits (phrases to add, examples to include).
    * Parse reflection into structured suggestions.
4. Textual-Gradient Expansion:
    * For each reflection g, feed g + current prompt into Editor prompt to produce q candidate edited prompts p'.
    * Also produce m directional edits per error group (ProTeGi notion of gradients).
    * For each p', optionally create paraphrases using Paraphrase Module.
5. Assemble Candidate Pool C from all expanded candidates (dedupe by hash).
6. Evaluate Candidates Efficiently:
    * Use bandit/selection algorithm to allocate evaluation samples across C under limited budget.
    * For each selected candidate, evaluate on small sampled Dsample to compute provisional scores.
    * Use selection algorithm (UCB/UCB-E/Successive Rejects) to choose b best candidates → new beam B.
7. Credit Assignment:
    * For each surviving prompt, compute per-component contribution:
        * Run counterfactuals: remove or alter one component (e.g., remove last example) and re-evaluate on a small sample to measure Δ metric.
        * If sequences of edits led to the prompt, propagate reward backward using TD update: Q(edit) += α * (reward_current + γ * max_future_reward - Q(edit)). (Here edits are "actions".)
    * Update per-component credit scores and Memory using these attributions.
8. Memory & Heuristics Update:
    * Store high-credit snippets into memory bank with tags (task type, conditions where it helped).
    * Update failure-mode → repair mapping (counts, success rates).
9. Adaptive controls:
    * If progress stalls, increase edit size or seed the beam with memory-snippets.
    * If overfitting observed, reduce paraphrase intensity or expand evaluation sample size to reduce noise.
10. Logging & Trace: Append iteration artifacts to Trace DB.
Repeat until iteration limit, budget exhausted, or metric converged.
C. Finalization
* Choose final prompt p* as best on Dval. Run final evaluation on Dtest. Save full optimization trace and exports (prompts, diffs, metrics).
* Optionally produce a human-readable “rationale” built from reflections and credit assignments summarizing why p* is good.

5 — Selection & bandit strategy (practical)
* Phase 1: Quick filter — evaluate all candidates on tiny c = 4 examples to remove obviously bad edits.
* Phase 2: Budgeted bandit (UCB-E or Successive Halving) — allocate remaining budget to accurately estimate top candidates. Recommended: use UCB-E with exploration parameter c = 2.0 (per ProTeGi defaults) or Successive Halving if you expect many low-quality candidates.
* Phase 3: Final ranking — evaluate top b on larger sample or full Dval.
Rationale: combine quick filtering (cheap) + focused budgeted measurement (accurate).

6 — Credit assignment details
* Counterfactual tests:
    * For each component C_i (e.g., example block, constraint line), create prompt_minus_i and evaluate small n_cf on Dmini. Estimate causal effect Δ_i = m(p) - m(prompt_minus_i).
* TD-style propagation:
    * Record the sequence of edits E = [e1, e2, ..., ek] that produced a prompt. On final reward R, for each action ej assign credit(ej) ← credit(ej) + α * (R - baseline) * discount^(k-j).
* Statistical aggregation:
    * Maintain moving average credit per component across iterations and tasks; use Bayesian shrinkage to avoid over-attribution from noisy small-sample deltas.
Use credits to:
* Lock (protect) high-credit fragments from destructive edits.
* Prefer edits that change low-credit components.

7 — Prompt templates (examples)
A. Reflection prompt template (to generate g / SR)

You are a critique assistant. Given:
- PROMPT: <<<p_text>>>
- INPUT: <<<x>>> 
- MODEL OUTPUT: <<<ŷ>>>
- GOLD / EXPECTED: <<<y>>>   # include if available; else say "unknown"

Task: Write a structured reflection:
1) Briefly summarize why the model output is incorrect or low-quality.
2) Tag failure types from: {ambiguous_instructions, missing_examples, format_mismatch, hallucination, logic_error, insufficient_context, other}
3) Propose 2-3 *specific* prompt edits (exact text snippets or sentences to add/change) that would likely fix the issue.

Return JSON: {"summary":"...", "tags":["..."], "edits":["...","..."]}
B. Textual-gradient edit prompt

Given PROMPT p and reflection g:
- Apply the reflection to p and produce 3 improved prompt variants that fix the issues in g.
- Make edits conservative (do not change task semantics) and produce short diff notes.

Return as list of { "prompt": "...", "edit_note":"..." }
C. Paraphrase prompt

Paraphrase the following prompt to produce a semantically equivalent variant with clearer phrasing or shorter sentences. Keep examples identical unless asked to reword them.
D. Evaluator (self-test) for code

Given the function spec and implementation, generate up to 6 unit tests (input-output pairs) that check correctness and edge cases. Validate tests by attempting to execute them and provide failure traces.

8 — Pseudocode (main loop)

beam = [p0]
memory = MemoryBank()
trace_db = TraceDB()
for iter in range(max_iters):
    Dmini = sample(Dtrain, size=minibatch_size)
    evals = evaluate_prompts(beam, Dmini)      # parallel calls
    reflections = []
    for p in beam:
        errors = collect_errors(p, Dmini)      # inputs where predictions != gt
        if errors:
            g = get_reflection(p, errors)      # LLM reflection -> structured
            reflections.append((p, g))
    candidates = []
    for p, g in reflections:
        edits = textual_gradient_edits(p, g, num_edits_per_gradient)
        for e in edits:
            candidates.append(e)
            candidates += paraphrase(e, paraphrases_per_candidate)
    candidates = dedupe(candidates)
    # Bandit-style evaluation
    top_candidates = bandit_select(candidates, Dtrain, budget=iter_budget, b=beam_width)
    # Credit assignment
    for cand in top_candidates:
        compute_counterfactuals_and_td(cand, history_of_edits)
    # Update memory with high-credit snippets
    memory.update_from(top_candidates)
    beam = top_candidates
    trace_db.log_iteration(...)
    if convergence_criteria_met():
        break
final_prompt = select_best(beam, Dval)
final_eval = evaluate(final_prompt, Dtest)
save_results(final_prompt, final_eval, trace_db)


9 — Practical hyperparameters / budgets (starting suggestions)
* minibatch_size = 16–64 depending on cost.
* beam_width b = 3–6 (larger beams increase diversity but cost).
* candidates_per_parent = 6–12.
* paraphrases_per_candidate = 1–3.
* iter_budget (API calls per iteration) = 50–200 (adjust by billing).
* max_iters = 6–12.
* alpha (TD learning rate) = 0.1, gamma (discount) = 0.9.
* Confidence levels for counterfactuals: do n_cf = 8 samples per test to estimate Δ.
Tune these on pilot tasks.

10 — Failure-mode taxonomy & automated repair strategies
When a reflection tags a failure, map to pre-coded repair actions:
* ambiguous_instructions → insert clarifying sentence, add examples, or rephrase goal.
* missing_examples → add 2 few-shot exemplars covering edge cases.
* format_mismatch → add explicit output format template (regex, JSON schema).
* hallucination → add grounding instructions: “Only answer using provided context”; optionally add retrieval step.
* logic_error → add stepwise reasoning scaffolding (Chain-of-Thought prompt).
* insufficient_context → add background facts or retrieval instructions.
Track success rate per repair and prefer the top-2 repairs historically.

11 — Memory & transfer learning
* Memory bank stores snippets with metadata (task type embeddings). For a new task, compute task signature embedding (e.g., example tokens, dataset labels) and retrieve top-K relevant snippets to seed initial prompt.
* Use retrieval-augmented prompt assembly: assemble initial prompt = seed instructions + top-memory-snippets + few-shot examples.
This speeds convergence and reuses successful prompt patterns.

12 — Monitoring, visualization & outputs
* Optimization trace dashboard:
    * Iteration slider + prompt diff viewer
    * Metric plot vs iterations (with variance bands)
    * Per-component credit heatmap
    * Failure-type frequency chart
* Artifacts to export:
    * Final prompt p* + rationale summary
    * Full trace (JSON)
    * Memory excerpts & success stats
    * Test harness (unit tests used for code tasks)

13 — Implementation & engineering notes
* Parallelization: Evaluate different prompts in parallel where API supports concurrency. Use asynchronous batching.
* Caching: Cache (prompt, input) -> output to avoid repeated API calls during counterfactuals.
* Budget control: Implement soft and hard budgets: soft to adapt exploration rate, hard to stop when exceeded.
* Robust parsing: Standardize LLM reflection output by enforcing JSON responses and fallback heuristics.
* Safety / content filtering: Add a safety step: if candidate prompt would encourage disallowed content, drop it.
* Reproducibility: Save random seeds, sample indices, and LLM temperature settings.

14 — Example short run (classification task)
1. p0: “Classify if text contains hate speech. Answer Yes/No.”
2. Iter1: model misclassifies sarcasm examples. Reflection: tags ambiguous_instructions and missing_examples. Suggests adding explicit handling for sarcasm + add 2 examples.
3. Textual-gradient edits: add “Treat sarcastic or indirect language carefully — use context” and insert examples.
4. Paraphrase variants produced.
5. Bandit selects two top candidates; counterfactual shows that wording “Treat sarcastic…” yields +6% F1. Credit assigned to that sentence.
6. Memory stores the sentence under classification:sarcasm with high credit.
7. Iterate until validation metric plateaus.

15 — Evaluation & ablations to run (recommended experiments)
* Ablate reflection module → measure drop (quantifies Reflexion value).
* Ablate textual-gradient edits (only paraphrase) → measure drop (quantifies ProTeGi value).
* Test different selection algorithms (UCB vs SR vs SH).
* Measure sample-efficiency: metric vs API-calls.
* Test transfer: initialize new task with memory vs without.

16 — Risks, limitations & safeguards
* Overfitting to Dtrain/minibatches — use held-out Dval & early stopping.
* Noisy credit from small samples — use aggregation and shrinkage.
* Misleading self-reflection (LLM may blame wrong cause) — mitigate by counterfactual testing and statistical validation of reflections.
* Cost — set budgets and caching; prefer few-shot examples vs large-scale evaluations.

17 — Deliverables & next steps I can produce for you (pick any, I’ll do it now)
* Full Python pseudocode implementation (async-ready) wired to an LLM API wrapper.
* A concrete set of reflection/edit/paraphrase prompt templates tuned for classification, code, and reasoning.
* Example notebook showing a simulated run (mocked LLM responses) so you can test orchestration before hitting API.
* Visualization mockups for the optimization trace dashboard.
Tell me which of those you want first and I’ll produce it now.
